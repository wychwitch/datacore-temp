# Overview

Datacore is a power tool for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), allowing you to create dynamic views
that gather and edit data from the files in your vault. Datacore has two components:

- A **database** which parses your Markdown files in the background for tags, links, frontmatter, sections, blocks, and other metadata, and organizes it in a format convienent for fast searching.
- A **renderer** which converts datacore codeblocks into nice-looking tables, lists, and so on, using the data in the database.

Datacore is a logical successor to the previous plugin Dataview, and shares the same core ideas as it.
